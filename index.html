        <p>Recently, my college organized a tech fest in which I participated in an event called "Developer's Mind." The objective of the event was to develop a centralized college club website. I took the lead in a team of two, and I was responsible for approximately 70% of the project's development. Although we didn't win the competition, we gained a lot of valuable experience and learned a great deal. As a team of freshmen, we received appreciation from the judges and received some valuable advice for our future endeavors.</p></div>

            <p>In the month of May, our college organized an institute-level hackathon called "Innovate-a-thon." I was a part of a team called Code Smashers, and we chose to work on the problem of creating an automatic certificate generator. In this project, I specifically worked as a member of the frontend development team and also My responsibility was to handle the feature that involved sending e-certificates directly to participants' emails through Google Sheets integration and handling database. proposed ppt:</p></div>
